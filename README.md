The main class (Core)

The OnTime framework is designed to be modular, scalable and comprehensive, so that each new feature integrates without difficulty and maintains a unique class definition (OnTime) and all "additional classes" are "trait" that enrich it, in such a way that an integrated system is obtained, not separate programs which do not necessarily have to behave correctly together.

Installation in test environment:

1.- Create an empty directory within the web container location (only for example purposes it is considered to be called “demo”).

2.- Copy all the files in the directory (make sure to assign user permissions)

3.- With the browser of your preference, locate the directory you created and enter it

4.- Execute the OntimeInstaller.php file

5.- When executing the file, an "OnTime" directory was created, the files were moved and the required environment was created

Recommendations:

If you know how to create a subdomain that points to the "demo" directory, it is more comfortable and realistic.

After install

When installing, the necessary environment is defined to define access security, I create a User called "Admin" and that his password is "OT2021Free", this environment left the class prepared 

All demo files have sample about especific part of the class
